vastengine
==========

vastengine is a 2D game engine written in JavaScript. It is currently in very early stages of development.

The goal is to provide a lightweight library to write 2D game for the web browser. The focus will be for mobile devices, particularly with the help of Phonegap or the likes, but desktop browsers are not to be ignored.
